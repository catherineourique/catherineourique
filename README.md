## About Me

I'm Catherine, a Brazilian full-stack software engineer with a strong background in physics and astrophysics. After years in academia exploring massive astronomical datasets and simulating biological systems, I transitioned into tech—where I build web applications and engineer data solutions with performance and scalability in mind.

Currently, I work as a **Senior Software Engineer at TELUS Digital**, designing robust, cloud-native systems with modern development practices and mentoring fellow engineers.

## What I Do

### Backend
- Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask)
- ETL processes and web scraping
- Microservices & APIs
- Cloud (AWS Lambda, S3, EC2)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Frontend
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Vue & Nuxt.js
- React & Next.js
- UI Libraries (Vuetify, Tailwind)

### Data & Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery
- AWS architecture
- High-performance data pipelines
- SSO integration (OAuth2 with Google, LinkedIn, Meta)

## Academic Background

**Ph.D. in Physics** – UFRGS  
Simulated viscoelastic biological cell dynamics using a hybrid Fortran + Python model.

**M.Sc. in Astrophysics** – UFRGS  
Analyzed white dwarf populations and proposed a new evolutionary scenario.

**B.Sc. in Physics** – UFRGS  
Estimated age and metallicity of globular clusters using stellar evolution models.
