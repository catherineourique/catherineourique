## About Me

I'm Catherine, a Brazilian full-stack software engineer with a strong background in physics and astrophysics. After years in academia exploring astronomical datasets and simulating biological systems, I transitioned into tech where I build web applications and engineer data solutions focused on performance and scalability.

Currently I work as a Senior Software Engineer at TELUS Digital, designing robust cloud-native systems using modern development practices and mentoring fellow engineers.

## What I Do

### Backend
- Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask)
- ETL processes and web scraping
- Microservices and APIs
- Cloud (AWS Lambda, S3, EC2)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Frontend
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- Vue and Nuxt.js
- React and Next.js
- UI libraries like Vuetify and Tailwind

### Data and Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery
- AWS architecture and deployment
- High-performance data pipelines
- SSO integration with OAuth2 (Google, LinkedIn, Meta)

## Academic Background

**PhD in Physics** — UFRGS  
Simulated viscoelastic biological cell dynamics using a hybrid Fortran and Python model.

**MSc in Astrophysics** — UFRGS  
Analyzed white dwarf populations and proposed a new evolutionary scenario.

**BSc in Physics** — UFRGS  
Estimated age and metallicity of globular clusters using stellar evolution models.
